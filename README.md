# MiWiki 
Welcome to MiWiki. This is our project for the subject Linguaggi e tecnologie per il Web.

In this website, you can host your own Wiki, in which you will be able to upload new articles, look for them using some fancy tools, visit and read the already created articles, etc.
You can also create and use different users, having the possibility of having an administrator to control the deletions of pages, as well as the categories to which they pertain.

Now you can see a quick description of each tab you will encounter in MiWiki:

## Home
Here you have some introductory text, a quick shortcut for searching entries and a couple of other things that will make your life easier.

## Search
Within this tab you can do some expert search on the database of created articles. First you have a text bar to look for entries that match their title with your input. And then you have a category filter, as well as the order criterion by which to sort the matching articles.

## New page
In this section you can create a new page for MiWiki.

First, choose a title for the page. Then, to load the content you have 2 possibilities:
    [1] Upload an already typed file
    [2] Manually type the article on this page
On the side, a real-time preview will be shown.
Finally, click on the green button to publish the article.

## Random page
You will get automatically redirected to a random page created in MiWiki.
It is always exciting to have some chaos in your life!

## Admin panel
This is an exclusive panel for admin users.

On this panel you can see the user reports about pages and categories.
When you make a report effective, the corresponding page/category will be erased.
You can also discard a report.

## My account
If you click on your name on the omnipresent top bar you can access this section.
In here, you will find the details about your account, as well as the entries you created on MiWiki.

You also have an option to change your password.
